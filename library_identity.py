# library_identity.py  (Fix-sprint Task J — library identity backbone)
# =============================================================================
# The durable "what IS this file" table. 94% of library files already sit under
# a tracked show_folder with an external id, and ~29846 are already matched to a
# specific episode row — yet dupes, rename, and presence checks used to re-derive
# identity from a filename regex every single time. This table stops that: once a
# file's identity is known (from an episode row, a show-folder mapping, a placed
# download, or a batch provider lookup), it is stored keyed by path and the
# consumers join against it instead of parsing strings.
#
# Contract:
#   - A row exists ONLY for a resolved file. An unresolved file has no row and
#     surfaces as unidentified. Never invent an identity.
#   - Rows are written at placement (the download pipeline knows the request
#     identity when it moves files), at manual resolve, and by the backfill job.
#   - Rows die with the file: remove_from_index / the refresh delta prune every
#     row whose path is no longer in the library_files index.
#   - provenance (resolved_by) is stored and surfaced; the consumers never
#     auto-act (delete/rename) on an inherited or batch-resolved identity without
#     showing it.
#
# This module imports only `db` at module scope so it stays importable under the
# CI pytest subset. Every heavier collaborator (shows_store, downloads_store,
# queue_store, media_lookup, verification, library_index, config) is imported
# lazily inside the function that needs it.
